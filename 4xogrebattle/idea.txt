Idea:
	!!Try to keep simple!!
	Game is about going from location to location clearing out the enemies in a Ogre Battle/Symphony of War style.
	Enemies on map spawn from certain tiles (caves, portals, etc).
    Player must move to these tiles, beat a boss/mini boss, to destroy the spawner.
	Player can earn gold on map, by recapturing building tiles, or defeating enemies
	Player can buy and equip units with gear inbetween levels.
    Gear should be kept simple to reduce balancing scope. Weapon and Armor only?
    Gear progression should be like Valkyrie Profile, where inbetween each level you get better options

Set up that will spawn player troops
Add in "select" action on selected or clicked tile, giving player options based on Entity linked to tile
Buildings to heal player units, when units occupy building tile
Selecting building tile shows occupying units, and other options if added?
Set up building tiles that need to be secured, with option for regular/mini boss/boss battle.
Set up overworld turn based movement
Troop movement range depends on unit stats, MIN 3, MAX 5
    Units should have move stat, MIN 0.1, MAX 0.4. (display as 1 through 4)
    6 units with higher move stats would result in 5 movement range
Fog of war (friendly buildings and units can see whats in tiles X tiles away)
	Should this be literal fog or darkness, except for around units?
	Will forest tiles hide entities unless a unit is in adjacent an tile?
    This will also hide player units from enemy ai

Build out entities and definitions for each building type
    Should more buildings have interactions?
        Barrack/ArcheryRange/Towers could enhance troop formations for X turns after using?

Overworld initiating battle when player and enemy units meet at a tile
Set up prototype player and enemy classes, with battle actions
Set up main inventory (small % of items), and unit inventories
Set up unit inventory/equipment
Set up building a battle scene with a 2nd camera, loading in the player and enemy units that met
Set up auto battling system (Symphony of War/Ogre Battle)
Battle rewards

Set up in between screen, player can buy the new gear, equip the units, buy new units, and adjust the unit groups
Set up map showing next battle, and clicking to begin
Player can save inbetween battles
